       "  {'text': \"\\n    \\n    \\n    I would now like to introduce today's host, Mr. Steve Eschbach, Vice President of Investor Relations at Integrys Energy Group. Sir, you may now begin.\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    Before we begin, I will advise everyone that this call is being recorded and will be available for audio replay through November 5, 2013.\\n    I will now turn this call over to Charlie Schrock.\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call today. I'll provide an overview of our second quarter and our year-to-date financial results, some recent operational highlights and our expectations for the balance of 2013.\\n    Jim Schott will discuss our financial results in more detail, and he will provide more information regarding our financial outlook. And as usual, we will conclude with a question-and-answer session.\\n    Turning to slide 5, diluted EPS adjusted was up in 2013 compared with 2012 for both the quarter and the first half of the year. This is shown on the table at the bottom of this slide. Given our performance so far this year and the results for the Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas rate cases, we are narrowing our 2013 guidance were diluted EPS adjusted to a range between $3.35 and $3.60 on a consolidated basis. This is an upward revision to the lower end of the guidance range of $3.25 that we presented in May. Jim will have more details on this during his formal remarks. But first, I'll provide a brief update on our operational activities.\\n    Let's take a look starting on slide number 6. The key development for our natural gas utility segment is that Illinois has adopted legislation for recovery of certain rate-based investments. The most notable of course is our Accelerated Main Replacement Program which we call AMRP. That legislation received strong support in both the Illinois House and Senate. On July 5, Governor Quinn signed into law what is now known as the Natural Gas Consumer Safety and Reliability Act.\\n    This law becomes effective on January 1, 2014 and we've included some of the key provisions on this slide. This law is important to Chicago and on behalf of the company, I extend our thanks to the bill sponsors, legislative leadership, labor unions, our employees and other stakeholders for their support and efforts to enact this legislation.\\n    And while we were working on this legislation, we continue to work on our main replacement project. We installed about 36 miles of main in Chicago during the second quarter and are on-track to complete about 90 miles of main installation during 2013.\\n    Turning to slide 7, the major note for the electric utility segment is related to our Fox Energy Center ownership. The second quarter was the first for WPS as owner and operator. Integration into our system has been smooth and operations are proceeding as expected. Recall that all ownership costs in excess of our previous Power Purchase Agreement expenses are being deferred including the equity return on investment for recovery in a subsequent rate case.\\n    With receipt of approval from the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin to install multi-pollutant control technology, called ReACT, on our Weston 3 plant, we are moving forward with the project. Construction will begin in the third quarter starting with site preparations. We expect the project to be in service in early 2016.\\n    Another positive development for our electric utility segment during the quarter was the PSCW approval to move forward with our system modernization and reliability project which will improve the electric reliability for our customers in Wisconsin. This five-year $220 million project will convert more than 1,000 miles of overhead electric distribution lines to underground. It also includes the installation of automation equipment on an additional 400 miles of line. Construction will begin next year and we have included this project in our 2014 Wisconsin public service rate case.\\n    Slide 8 summarizes key developments regarding our rate case activity. We received a final order in our Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas rate cases on June 28 and new rates became effective on June 27. A summary of our initial filing and final outcome can be found in the appendix on slides 22 and 23. Our other rate cases are also proceeding as expected.\\n    Turning to slide 9 for our non-regulated operations. We're continuing to make solid progress on growing our market share as both delivered and forward volumes are up versus the same period a year ago. Unit margin compression continues, which is having a dampening effect on Integrys Energy Services' results. However, returns in the business continue to stay strong. I'll now turn the call over to Jim Schott. Jim?\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    Thank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. I'll cover our financial results for the second quarter and year-to-date 2013 in a little more detail and discuss our financial expectations for the rest of 2013. Let's begin with a financial review by turning to slide 10.\\n    In the second quarter of 2013, we posted diluted EPS adjusted of $0.45 per share, up from $0.27 per share in the same period a year ago. For the year-to-date comparison, we posted diluted EPS adjusted of $2.20 in 2013 versus $1.83 in 2012. Taking into account – taking into consideration the weather and decoupling reserve adjustments in the three month and six month periods for each year, the second quarter results were $0.05 per share better in 2013 than the same period a year ago. And the year-to-date results in 2013 were $0.08 lower than the comparable period in 2012.\\n    For year-to-date results, this is due to the regulatory lag for Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas. Cost increased in the first half of the year, including for our AMRP investment, but new rates did not go into effect until the end of June.\\n    On slide 11, we show the changes in diluted EPS adjusted by segment and key variances for the three month and six month period in 2013 compared with the same period in 2012. The three month and six month financial results for 2013 are better than the same period a year ago for our regulated utilities. Unit margin compression at Integrys Energy Services continues to impact period-over-period results.\\n    On slide 12, we've updated our capital expenditure projections. Of note, we have increased the Peoples Gas spend given the new Illinois law allowing current recovery of our AMRP costs. Changes at our other utilities are not material. Reductions and/or shifts in expenditures at Integrys Energy Services, Integrys Transportation Fuels, and American Transmission Company reflect changes in near-term project opportunities.\\n    Slide 13 shows our estimated utility depreciation for 2013 through 2015.\\n    And slide 14 shows our updated projected rate base growth through 2015. This chart continues to show the strong growth in rate base over the next couple of years.\\n    Moving on to slide 15, let me review our financing plans for 2013 as some activity has occurred here. As we discussed during our March call, we returned to issuing new shares of stock to meet the needs of our Stock Investment Plan and other stock-based benefit plans such as stock option exercise activity.\\n    We have raised about $55 million under this program through June 30, with another $20 million expected to be raised for the balance of the year, plus any equity issuances for stock option exercise activity that may occur.\\n    Turning to our long-term debt transactions where Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas are now behind us. Still up on the horizon is $450 million of long-term debt issuance for Wisconsin Public Service. In addition, up to $400 million of hybrid debt security issuance for Integrys Energy Group. Both issuances are planned to take place between now and year-end.\\n    At this time, we are planning the hybrid security issue earlier rather than later in the period. Our financing plans for Integrys Energy Group are expected to continue to support our current credit ratings.\\n    Turning to slide 16. As Charlie indicated, our guidance for 2013 diluted EPS adjusted is now in the range of $3.35 to $3.60, with a midpoint of $3.47. The slide also shows how our revised guidance improved by comparing the two what we presented to you in May. The changes reflected in two of our segments. For the regulated natural gas utility segment, we have increased and narrowed our guidance range to $1.36 to $1.44. This change was primarily driven by the final rate case outcomes for People's Gas and North Shore Gas. For the holding company and other segment, we are reducing our guidance range to a loss of $0.15 to $0.09. This reflects the potential acceleration of the hybrid debt from later in the period to earlier in the period as well as the increase in interest rates.\\n    I will turn the call back over to Charlie. Charlie?\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    Thanks, Jim. Before taking your questions, I'll summarize our key investment highlights shown on slide 17. As you can see, the execution of our business plan for the regulated utilities remains on track. We continue to make prudent investments in our utilities to provide safe, reliable and affordable service for our customers. Our 34% ownership in the American Transmission Company continues to contribute to earnings as expected.\\n    Our long-term plan is for our regulated businesses to contribute about 85% to 90% of our consolidated net income and our non-regulated businesses to contribute the remaining 10% to 15%. Our business risk profile today is commensurate with this mix of regulated and non-regulated businesses.\\n    Our guidance for 2013, diluted EPS adjusted on a consolidated basis is in the range of $3.35 to $3.60. Our portfolio of regulated and non-regulated businesses, operational excellence initiatives and cost control efforts will enable us to meet our 2013 consolidated financial objectives. Given the investments in our portfolio of businesses and assuming continued reasonable rate treatment, we expect average annualized growth and diluted EPS adjusted to be between 4% and 6% on an average annualized basis through 2015 with 2011 as the base year. And given our solid long-term business plan and portfolio of businesses, our current dividend is sustainable and our dividend payout ratio will decline to utility industry norms as our earnings grow over time.\\n    Finally, as a reminder, we will conduct Analyst Day in New York tomorrow morning and invite you to listen in to a live webcast. You'll find the link to the webcast on our website.\\n    We'll now open the call for your questions related to today's earnings and the 2013 financial summary.\\n    \\n    \\n    \"}),\n",

       "  {'text': \"\\n    \\n    \\n    Good morning. My name is Rachel and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Eaton Vance Corp. Fourth Fiscal Quarter Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.  Thank you.\\n    Dan Cataldo, you may begin your conference.\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    I'll now turn the call over to Tom.\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, we're reporting adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.13 for our fiscal year ended October 31, down 7% from $2.29 of adjusted earnings per diluted share in fiscal 2015. This year, our earnings reflect a 4% decline in revenue and substantially unchanged adjusted operating expenses.\\n    Due to the strong recovery in equity markets since the February low and the company's positive internal growth, our earnings however improved meaningfully over the course of the fiscal year, setting up favorable earnings comparisons in fiscal 2017 as Laurie will detail on a few minutes we earned $0.57 per diluted share in the fourth fiscal quarter, an increase of 8% from $0.53 of earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, and up 2% from $0.56 of adjusted earnings per diluted per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Income and net gains on seed capital investments contributed $0.01 to earnings per diluted share in the fourth and third quarters of fiscal 2016, and reduced earnings per diluted share by $0.01 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.\\n    Performance fees contributed less than $0.005 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 versus a contribution of about $0.01 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and $0.015 in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. We finished fiscal 2016 with consolidated assets under management of $336.4 billion, up 8% from 12 months earlier and up 1% from the end of the third fiscal quarter.\\n    Consolidated net inflows of $4.8 billion in the fourth quarter equate to a 6% annualized internal growth rate, matching our organic growth rate for fiscal 2016 as a whole. Excluding our over fee exposure management business organic growth in assets under management was 3% for the fourth quarter and 5% for the fiscal year in total.\\n    While net flows in organic growth in AUM are standard measures of asset manager business performance, we find it increasingly important to understand and track organic revenue growth. Organic revenue growth as we define represent the change in run rate management fee revenue resulting from net inflows and outflows taking into account the fee rate applicable to each $1 in or out.\\n    In the fourth quarter, we realized organic revenue growth of 2% a third consecutive quarter of positive organic revenue growth. For the fiscal year as a whole, we had organic revenue growth of just over 1%.\\n    [Technical Difficulty]\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    Ladies and gentlemen, the conference will continue momentarily. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the operator, today's conference will continue momentarily. Thank you for your patience.\\n    Ladies and gentlemen the conference will begin momentarily. Please standby.\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    Ladies and gentlemen, please standby, the conference will continue momentarily. Thank you for your patience.\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    Ladies and gentlemen, the conference will continue momentarily, please standby.\\n    Okay. Op, are you there, operator? Hello?\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    Okay. And this is Dan Cataldo, apparently our call got cut off, so we apologize for that, we're not sure precisely where we were, when it cut off, but Tom is going to go back and start with the update on our custom beta business and again, we apologize for this and if there are any questions, as a result please don't hesitate to let us know.\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    Hi, it's Tom, again. So, my apologies if we don't pick up where things cut off, which we don't know exactly where that was. I talked about our four key growth initiatives and where we are with those in total and I have some specific comments about two of those, our custom beta and NextShares initiative and drop. I'll pickup and just repeat what I may have said or at least – I said at least to the group here, may have said publicly, but I'll start on custom beta. For those who are not familiar, this is a suite of separately managed account of count strategies that combine the benefits of passive investing with the ability to customize portfolio to meet individual investor preferences and needs. Our custom beta line-up currently includes Parametric core equities, and EVM-managed municipal bond and corporate bond ladders.\\n    Compared to index ETFs and index mutual funds, our custom beta offerings give clients the ability to tailor their exposures to achieve better tax outcomes and to reflect client specified responsible investing criteria, factor tail  and portfolio exclusions.\\n    Unlike ETFs and mutual funds, custom beta separate accounts can pass through harvested tax losses to offset client gains and other investments. Transition costs and taxes may also be reduced by funding positions in time. Including in our presentation materials is a slide showing the growth of our custom beta strategies offered as retail and high network separate accounts over the past five years.\\n    As you can see, our managed assets and custom beta strategies have grown rapidly year-by-year, now approaching $45 billion. Fiscal 2016 net inflows of $9.2 billion represent a 28% internal growth rate, although custom beta fees are well below traditional active management. This is a highly scalable business for which we see huge growth opportunities as we continue to build-out a distribution network and product offerings. We recently launched a new website at custombeta.com, which I encourage you to check out.\\n    Now, turning to NextShares. I'll start by reminding that NextShares are a new type of fund, recently approved by the SEC that combines proprietary active management with the conveniences and potential performance and tax advantages of exchange-traded products. Our NextShares Solutions subsidiary holds pass and other intellectual property rights related to NextShares, and is seeking to commercialize NextShares by entering into licensing and service agreements with foreign companies. The first three NextShares funds were launched by Eaton Vance and began trading on Nasdaq in February and March of this year.\\n    Last month, Waddell & Reed launched the first three NextShares funds by an advisor other than Eaton Vance. Also recently, Interactive Brokers, an automated global electronic broker and market maker began offering NextShares funds to retail investors and financial professionals through its investing and trading platforms.\\n    UBS continues to make good progress towards the goal announced in July of offering NextShares funds through its network of 7,100 financial advisors in the U.S. UBS' plan is to begin offering NextShares on its brokerage platform in the first part of 2017, and then on its advisory platform later in the year. Every indication is that UBS is on schedule and committed to making NextShares a meaningful part of its U.S. fund business. Their support helps answer the one remaining question that stands in the way of NextShares gaining broad adoption by fund companies, which is where can we get large scale distribution. Assuming that everything at UBS remains on track, their support sets the stage for NextShares fund launches by a wide range of leading fund sponsors in 2017.\\n    The three NextShares funds we introduced earlier this year now have seven months to eight months of live investment and share trading experience, both of which have been consistent with expectations. All three funds are outperforming each share class of the corresponding mutual fund, and their shares are trading at consistently tight bid-ask spreads and there are premium discounts to fund NAV.\\n    As the investment and trading advantage of NextShares are demonstrated over a broader range of funds, and experienced by growing number of investors, we expect to attract more broker dealers in an ever-widening array of fund sponsors and fund strategists to the NextShares opportunity.\\n    While true innovation is never easy, we continue to be excited by the potential of NextShares. 2017 promises to be a year of significant progress. In other notable developments, last month, we announced the execution of a definitive agreement for Eaton Vance to acquire the assets of Calvert Investment Management. Founded in 1976 and based in Bethesda, Maryland Calvert is a recognized leader in responsible investing, with approximately $12.3 billion in assets under management as of September 30. The Calvert Funds are one of the largest and most diversified families, who responsibly invest in mutual funds, encompassing actively and passively managed equity, fixed income, and asset allocation strategies managed in accordance with the Calvert principals for responsible investment.\\n    The investment performance of The Calvert Fund is generally strong with 77% of assets and funds with Morningstar ratings of 4, 5 stars as of September 30. Most of Calvert's investment strategies incorporate consideration of environmental sustainability and corporate governance or ESG issues. The Calvert sustainability research department has dedicated the evaluation of companies based on the ESG factors and most relevant to their businesses.\\n    Done well this analysis can provide value even to funds and account that are not managed towards the responsible investing mandate. Responsible investing is widely recognize as one of the leading trends in the asset management industry today, appealing to investors who seek both financial returns and positive societal impact from their investments. Responsible investing has been embraced by many of Eaton Vance's most important business partners, as two examples Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Merrill Lynch have each announced major initiatives to support sustainable and positive impact investing.\\n    Given that particular appeal to younger investors it seems highly likely that demand for responsible investing will continue to grow. As part of Eaton Vance we see tremendous potential to Calvert to extend its leadership position among responsible investment managers by applying our management and distribution resources and oversight we believe we can help Calvert become a meaningfully larger better and more impactful company.\\n    The transaction is subject to fund shareholder approvals and other customary closing conditions and is scheduled to close on or about December 31, of this year. We look forward to welcoming Calvert to the Eaton Vance family. Since the purchase of our controlling interest in Atlanta Capital in 2001 and Parametric in 2003, acquisitions of complementary asset management businesses have been a key component of Eaton Vance's business growth. In the acquisition of Calvert, we've significant opportunity to further advance our growth objectives by helping Calvert achieve its full potential as a leader in responsible investing.\\n    That concludes my prepared remarks. And I'll now turn the call over to Laurie.\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    Thank you, Tom, and good morning. As detailed in our earnings release, we're reporting adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.13 for fiscal 2016 versus $2.29 a year ago. On a GAAP basis, we earned $2.12 per diluted share in fiscal 2016 and $1.92 per diluted share in fiscal 2015. As you can see an attachment to our press release $0.01 adjustment to fiscal 2016 earnings per diluted share, primarily reflects the closed-end fund structuring fees we paid in the third quarter. While the $0.37 adjustment from reported GAAP earnings in fiscal 2015, primarily reflects the one-time payment we made to terminate certain closed-end fund service and additional compensation arrangements.\\n    Excluding the payment, adjusted operating income declined by 12% year-over-year and adjusted operating margins dropped from 34% to 31%, reflecting a 4% decline in revenue and operating expense that was substantially unchanged.\\n    Our fourth quarter results show modestly improved revenue and profits both year-over-year and sequentially. We're reporting adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.57 for the fourth quarter fiscal 2016 compared to $0.53 for the fourth quarter fiscal 2015, and $0.56 for the third quarter fiscal 2016. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 are the same as reported GAAP earnings, while the penny adjustment from reported GAAP earnings of a $0.55 in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 reflects the closed-end fund structuring fees we paid last quarter.\\n    Fourth quarter revenue was up 2% versus both the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and the third quarter of fiscal 2015. We maintained adjusted operating margins of 32% in the final quarter of the fiscal year flat versus the prior quarter despite losing $2.9 billion in managed assets due to October market decline, although we've seen opportunity for modest margin expansion longer term, we would anticipate that adjusted margins will likely stand this range for the first half of fiscal 2017, given seasonal compensation pressures.\\n    As Tom mentioned, asset growth in fiscal 2016 was strong with average managed assets up 6% in comparison with the prior fiscal year reflecting strong net sales and positive market returns for the year. Revenue declined 4% year-over-year trailing asset growth as our effective management fee rates continue to trend down, the decline in our average effective investment advisory and administrative fee rate from 39 basis points in fiscal 2015, 36 basis points in fiscal 2016 could be primarily attributed to significant growth in our comparatively lower fee exposure management and portfolio implementation franchises, but strong growth and lower fee franchises will likely continue to exert pressure on our overall average effective fee rate going forward. Growth of well-performing actively managed strategies may provide some level of counter pressure and contribute to the stabilization of average effective fee rates in longer term.\\n    Comparing fourth quarter results to same quarter last year, 11% growth in average managed assets more than offset the decline in our average effective fee rate and the reduction in quarterly performance fees, driving a 3% increase in investment advisory and administrative fees. Sequentially a 4% increase in average managed assets drove at 2% increase in investment advisory and administrative fee. Performance fees, which are excluded from the calculation of our average effective fee rates contributed approximately $600,000 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to $2.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and $2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.\\n    In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, the realized 2% annualized internal revenue growth and 6% annualized internal asset growth, with the revenue contribution from new sales during the quarter, exceeding the revenue loss from redemptions and other withdrawals. Despite the persistent pressure on average fee rate, we believe we could continue to sustain positive annualized internal revenue growth, provided the withdrawals from our higher fee strategies don't accelerate.\\n    Turning to expenses. Compensation expense increased by just under 2% in fiscal 2016, primarily reflecting a 4% increase in head count, support growth at Parametric and new initiatives at Eaton Vance management, partially offset by a decrease in sales base and our operating income base incentive.\\n    Compensation expense increased to 37% of revenue in fiscal 2016 from 34% in fiscal 2015, primarily driven by the decline in revenue. We anticipate the compensation as a percentage of revenue, we'll stay in the 37% range in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, given traditional seasonal pressures, associated with payroll, tax clock reset, 401(k) funding, year-end base salary increases, and stock-based compensation acceleration associated with employee retirements. Controlling our compensation costs and other discretionary spending remains top of mind as we move into the new fiscal year.\\n    Distribution related costs, including distribution and service fee expenses, and the amortization of deferred sales commission decreased 27% in fiscal 2016, primarily reflecting the $73 million paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, determinate certain closed-end fund service and additional compensation arrangement. Excluding this payment, distribution related cost decreased 6% year-over-year, reflecting lower average managed assets and fund share classes subject to the fees. Fourth quarter distribution related expenses were down 3% sequentially and 2% year-over-year.\\n    Fund related expenses which consist primarily of sub-advisory fees and fund expenses borne on funds for which we earn and all-in fee, were substantially unchanged in fiscal 2016.\\n    Other operating expenses were up 4% in fiscal 2016 primarily reflecting increases in information technology spending related to corporate initiatives. In terms of specific initiative spending, expenses related to NextShares totaled approximately $8 million in fiscal 2016 versus approximately $7.4 million in fiscal 2015. Net income and gains on seed capital investments contributed $0.01 to earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter and third quarter of fiscal 2016, and reduced earnings per diluted share by a $0.01 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. When quantifying the impact of our seed capital investments on earnings each quarter, we take into consideration our pro-rata share of the gains, losses and other investment income earned on investments in sponsored products where they're accounted for as consolidated funds, separate accounts or equity method investments, as well as the gains and losses recognized on derivatives used to hedge these investments.\\n    We then report the per share impact, net of non-controlling interest expense and income taxes. We continue to hedge the market exposures of our seed capital portfolio to the extent practicable to minimize the effect on quarterly earnings.\\n    Excluding the effects of CLO entity earnings and losses, our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 was 38.3% versus 38.5% in the third quarter of fiscal 2016, and 38.6% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.\\n    In capital management, we repurchased 1.2 million shares of non-voting common stock for approximately $47.9 million in the fourth quarter fiscal 2016. When combined with repurchases over the preceding three quarters, we reduced our weighted average diluted shares outstanding by 4% for the fiscal year and our ending shares outstanding from a $115.9 million on October 31, 2015 to $114 million on October 31, 2016.\\n    We finished our fourth fiscal quarter holding $509.9 million of cash, cash equivalents in short-term debt security and approximately $312.9 million in seed capital investments. Our outstanding debt consist of $215 million of 6.5% senior notes due in 2017 and $325 million of 3.65% senior notes due in 2023.\\n    We also have a $300 million five-year line of credit, which is currently undrawn.\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    Okay. Thanks, Laurie. I think we have a good sense now as to where, where the call cut off earlier. So, I think Tom is just going to make a few more comments and then we will open it up to questions.\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    Thanks, Dan. The – apparently the one topic that we didn't cover that we'd like to cover now is the breakdown of our flows. Just a little a color on the flows in the quarter. In our forward reporting, I think it was observed by us and others that the trends we had in the fourth quarter were generally consistent with the third quarter. Perhaps, the one exception was Parametric's portfolio implementation business, where we had net outflows of about a $100 million in the fourth quarter compared to $2.9 billion of net inflows in the prior quarter.\\n    All of this decline was attributable to institutional mandates for which the longer-term trends remain strongly positive even with the down fourth quarter, institutional portfolio manager – institutional portfolio implementation mandates contributed over $4.5 billion to our fiscal 2016 net inflows. Our fourth quarter net inflows into fixed income of $1.7 billion were lead by municipal bond and corporate bond ladders with support from active high-yield and managed muni strategies.\\n    Alternative strategy net inflows of almost $700 million were driven by sales of our two global macro mutual funds with strong performance records now over multiple periods. And equity net inflows which were moderately positive, had contributions from Parametric and Atlanta Capital-managed strategies, which were somewhat offset by net outflows from Eaton Vance managed equities.\\n    In floating rate bank loans, we have net outflows of $600 million in the fourth quarter versus $500 million in the third quarter. The decision by one major intermediary to reallocate away from bank loans accounted for essentially all of the fourth quarter net outflows meaning that net flows from all other sources were substantially flat. While we continue to be subject to these type of lumpy single decision maker flows both positive and negative, market sentiment towards the bank loan has clearly turned. After a long wait we are now seeing consistent deal in net inflows in to our retail bank loan strategies, no doubt influenced by the specter of rising interest rates.\\n    Following back to back years of bank loan net outflows totally nearly $9 billion. We appear to be entering a much more favorable environment for our floating rate income business. In a rising interest rate environment, fixed income investors often look to exit longer duration vehicles to minimize the impact of rising rates on their principal assuming that income generation continues to be a priority.\\n    A logical alternative frequently to invest in floating rate in long duration income strategies. As shown in our list a 4 star and 5 start rated funds, we offer not only a highly competitive line of floating-rate bank loan funds, but also range of top performing short-duration tax bond, municipal income funds that are positioned to gain assets in a rising rate environment. We're now starting to see a pickup in investor demand for these products related to other income managers, our leading position in bank loans and other floating rate and short duration strategies places that's very favorable for business growth in a period of raising interest rates.\\n    So, with that we'll conclude our prepared remarks and open the floor to questions and again our apologies for the interruption.\\n    \\n    \\n    \"}),\n",

       "  {'text': \"\\n    \\n    \\n    Following today's presentation we will conduct a question-and-answer session. \\n    I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Doug Pike, Vice President-Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    During today's call we're going to focus on third quarter 2013 performance, the current environment and a brief review of active projects and the near term outlook. With that being said, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    Thank you for joining our Earnings Call. As Doug mentioned, a set of presentation slides accompanies this call and is available on our website.\\n    Let's take a look at Slide Number 4 and review a few financial highlights. The third quarter continued the trends of the first half of the year. We generated $1.53 billion of EBITDA. This led to income from continuing operations of $854 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.51. I would like to highlight the bar charts on this page and the steady performance that we have realized. Industry conditions, particularly around oil and natural gas pricing, coupled with our strong operations and business portfolio have led to consistent quarterly results. This type of performance is seldom associated with cyclical businesses like Chemicals and Refining. While we have had some volatility among our product groups and normal seasonality across the year, we have achieved quite steady results overall. We will look at the details of individual businesses later in the call. During the quarter we declared a regular interim dividend of $0.50 per share and repurchased 13.5 million shares.\\n    If you would turn to Slide Number 5 you will see our year-to-date safety results. Overall our safety statistics continued to be among the very best in the industry, but we have not improved year on year. We believe that safety perfection is achievable, and to get there we must have continuous improvement. We want no one hurt on the job, not even the minor injuries we have experienced. We will press even harder in the coming days.\\n    I'd like to now turn the call over to Karyn to discuss our financial performance.\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    Thanks, Jim. Please turn to Slide Number 6, which shows third quarter EBITDA by segment. As Jim said, the quarter generally reflected conditions that prevailed throughout 2012 and the first half of 2013. This consistency is repeated in our segment earnings. As you can see, the third quarter earnings profile is very similar to the pattern of the last 12 months.\\n    During the quarter, O&P Americas generated EBITDA of $841 million. Exclusive of planned maintenance at our Clinton site, our ethylene assets continue to operate near 100% of capacity. O&P EAI EBITDA was $204 million, a third consecutive quarter of $200 million or better performance.\\n    The Intermediates & Derivatives segment EBITDA was $427 million, strong results in the oxy  field and styrene added to steady performance in propylene oxide following second quarter turnarounds.\\n    Refining segment EBITDA was slightly above break-evens, poor gasoline spreads coupled with rent  costs and facility maintenance more than offset an improved heavy-light  spread.\\n    On the right side of the slide you see a similar pattern across the last 12 month segment EBITDA. The O&P Americas and Intermediate & Derivatives segments have stood out throughout the period.\\n    Before discussing our cash flow, I want to mention two other items. First regarding our cash fixed costs our annual underlying cash fixed costs continue to run at a level consistent with prior year as cost reductions offset inflation. However due to timing factors our second half costs are expected to run a few percentage points above the first half rate. We experienced a similar trend last year. Second our third quarter effective rate is somewhat below the annual run rate. The quarter was impacted by certain discrete items which reduced tax expense by approximately $25 million net. These items include changes in bank wage  allowances and the closing of certain prior year tax audits.\\n    We will not turn to Slides #7 and #8. I'd like to discuss cash generation and deployment. During the quarter cash from operating activities continued to be very strong at $1.3 billion exclusive of working capital changes. Capital spending was $423 million consistent with our plan. We spent $981 million towards our share repurchase program and declared $280 million in dividends which were paid in October. As I mentioned on the second quarter call during July we took advantage of available interest rates and issued 10 and 30 year bonds totalling $1.5 billion in principal at an average coupon rate of 4.6%. As a result our cash balance increased to $4.4 billion and we closed the quarter with an outstanding share count of 557 million shares.\\n    On the right side of the slide you see similar metrics for the last 12 months. I want to highlight a few items. First operations including the impact of working capital changes generated $4.6 billion. From this cash flow we invested $1.5 billion in our capital program and returned $3.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\\n    On Slide #8 we provide further detail of the past three years of cash generation and deployment. Since becoming a public company during May of 2010 we have generated $13.8 billion of cash from operations. Approximately $3.8 billion has been reinvested in our assets while $7.1 billion has been returned to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Now I'll turn the call back to Jim.\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    Thanks, Karyn. Let's discuss segment performance beginning on Slide #9 with Olefins & Polyolefins Americas. Third quarter EBITDA was $841 million approximately $110 million less than the record second quarter results. Approximately $65 million of the decline can be attributed to our schedule maintenance turnaround at our Clinton Ethylene Polyethylene site.\\n    Joint venture equity income was $7 million and we received dividends of $15 million versus in second quarter the ethylene contract price declined by approximately $0.01 per pound. The cost of both naphtha and propane feed stock increased during the quarter. Gulf Coast ethane costs decreased by approximately $0.03 per gallon. Increased propylene prices caused us to restart our Metathesis unit which produces propylene from ethylene. During the quarter the unit produced approximately 100 million pounds of propylene contributing approximately $25 million to EBITDA. Exclusive of the turnaround and the Metathesis unit operation our ethylene production averaged 98% of nameplate capacity.\\n    Our olefin operations continued to outperform the industry. Approximately 87% of our ethylene production was from NGLs. Ethane accounted for 70% and propane 15%. Combined polyolefin results improved versus the second quarter. Our average third quarter polyethylene price increased slightly less than $0.02 per pound. Sales volumes were relatively unchanged. Polypropylene volume increased by approximately 5%. The price spread over propylene decreased by $0.01 per pound.\\n    Entering the fourth quarter we have benefited from the restart of our Clinton facility. During the winter months it's not uncommon to experience seasonally high raw material costs but thus far this has not been a significant factor.\\n    Let's turn to Slide #10 and review our performance in the Olefins & Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. Third quarter EBITDA was $204 million a decline of $91 million versus the second quarter. Joint venture equity income was $48 million and we received dividends of $77 million. Olefin results declined by approximately $75 million. Increased naphtha raw material cost coupled with a reduced benefit from cracking LPGs were primarily responsible for the decline. During the quarter our Olefin plant operating rates were greater than 90% well above industry averages. We produced approximately 40% of our ethylene from advantage feed stocks but the incentive over naphtha cracking declined. Overall the feed stock advantage benefited results by approximately $40 million versus naphtha.\\n    During the quarter we started production at our Wesseling butadiene expansion and finished the quarter demonstrating design capacities. Margins on the incremental production are protected by contract floor pricing. However this is not the case for the base production volumes. Our third quarter average butadiene price declined by approximately $0.30 per pound contributing to decreased EBITDA. Underlying polyolefin results were relatively unchanged. Margin improvements in both polyethylene and polypropylene offset volume declines of 8% and 11% respectively. Second quarter volumes were particularly strong while third quarter volumes were consistent with recent history. Combined polypropylene compounds and Polybutene-1 EBITDA declined by approximately $15 billion. Increased propylene costs were not immediately passed through to the customer base leading to a margin decline in our Compounding business.\\n    Volumes declined following typical seasonal patterns and auto industry vacation schedules. Year-to-date EBITDA is relatively unchanged versus 2012. October business fundamentals have been relatively consistent with third quarter conditions. However it is typical to experience a holiday related slowdown later in the fourth quarter.\\n    Before I move into the next segment I wanted to make a few comments about our restructuring efforts in EAI. We are often asked whether we are realizing the benefits of this effort. I appreciate the visibility can be difficult given the volatility of key business drivers so I want to review some details. Since 2011 our annual cash fixed costs have declined moderately while offsetting inflation. This has been achieved both through shuttering polyolefin capacity and reducing manpower. For example, we have reduced our Business and Sales staff by approximately 30%.\\n    We have also announced restructuring efforts at our Wesseling site and within Global R&D. While these latest programs are currently underway you won't see the impact of these actions in our financial results until next year. Over the past three years we have closed and consolidated approximately 500 million pounds of European polyolefin production capacity. We have also aggressively pursued raw material savings and flexibility. This was quite evident during recent quarters when we produced approximately 40% of our European ethylene from advantage feed stocks we're running our plants at greater than industry operating rates. As a consequence we believe that our results have outperformed the European industry. Although we don't have these opportunities every quarter we are now well prepared to act when market opportunities arise.\\n    Next please turn to Slide #11 for a discussion of our Intermediates & Derivatives segment. Third quarter EBITDA was $427 million an $89 million increase versus the prior quarter. Propylene oxide and derivative results increased by approximately $20 million. The increase was primarily due to improved volumes following second quarter turnarounds. Results for the other chemicals in the segment increased approximately $65 million. Approximately a third of the increase was due to increased styrene and C4 chemical volumes following the turnarounds. The balance was primarily related to improved styrene margins. Industry consultants report that styrene raw material margins increased by approximately $0.03 per pound.\\n    The final area of improvement was in oxyfuels as margin improvements contributed an estimated $15 million of additional EBITDA. Thus far in the fourth quarter propane oxide and derivative business conditions have been relatively steady. Oxyfuel margins have declined following the typical seasonal trend. Styrene margins have also declined by remain above historic norms.\\n    Let's move to Slide Number 12 for a discussion of the Refining segment. Third quarter was disappointing as we generated only $8 million of EBITDA. Crude throughput was 250,000 barrels per day. Reduced rates for a portion of the quarter to correct constraints in our vacuum tower. This impacted results by an estimated $30 million but going forward, yields an approximate $5 million monthly improvement. The industry benchmark Maya 2-1-1 spread increased by approximately $1.64 per barrel. A portion of our crude is purchased is based on brand or WTI benchmark pricing less a discount for crude quality. Versus the second the brand and WTI benchmarks increased by approximately $7 and $12 respectively. The Maya benchmark crude price increased by approximately $1.66 per barrel and our average crude price increased by approximately $4 per barrel. Since our average crude price increased more than Maya, we did not benefit from the increased crack spread.\\n    Third quarter RIN costs were approximately $35 million. The cost spiked early in the quarter before declining following remarks from the EPA. RIN prices at the end of the quarter were approximately $0.50 per gallon. Recently they have traded at $0.25 to $0.40 per gallon. To help reduce the costs of meeting the renewable fuel requirements we have developed a renewal diesel project, upgrading vegetable oil to diesel quality. This is a small project that started production this month. At full capacity it can reduce RIN purchases by approximately 15%.\\n    Looking forward, negative pricing trends have continued into October. Gasoline spreads are very weak placing significant pressure on industry benchmark spreads. The chart on the lower left provides some perspective of the decline. Given an oversupplied gasoline market, we expect the fourth quarter to be another difficulty quarter. Given this challenging environment we are taking actions to improve profitability. Among these actions have been the diversification of our crude supply and broadening of the refinery operating window. We currently have access to some discounted Canadian crudes and during the second half of 2014 we should see a significant increase in availability. In addition we have enhanced our sulfur lydens  and aromatics operational capabilities.\\n    We have also reduced our fixed costs by approximately $30 million and our working capital by $200 million during the past three years. We have taken actions to reduce the impact of increased renewal fuels costs both through the export of finished fuels and implementing the renewal diesel project. We believe that we are taking the right steps and in the future the benefits of our action should become more visible.\\n    Before I wrap up my prepared remarks I'd like to spend a few minutes updating you on the status of our expansion projects. We are in an exciting period during which we will bring several growth projects to fruition. In fact over a 30 month period we will complete a major project on average every six months. Slides 13 through 16 provide an update on the program and the individual projects. These figures represent our current thinking on timing, cost and benefit. Our projected benefits are based on the last 12 months average industry benchmark margins which of course are not always indicative of future margins.\\n    Collectively these projects represent an increase of approximately $1 billion of annual EBITDA at these conditions. Since first discussing these projects at Investor Day we have advanced project definitions and cost estimates. We currently estimate that the current cumulative costs of these projects has increased by an estimated 10% to 15%. There has been a similar 10% to 15% increase in benefits as both ethylene and methanol margins have increased. The projects remain on schedule.\\n    I'd like to provide a quick update on each project. The Weaseling Butadiene expansion is complete and operating. Project economics were protected by our contracting strategy and the inclusion of minimum margins. The Methanol Restart is 90% complete. We expect to mechanically complete the project this quarter. I expect that we will reach full operating capacity during the first quarter of 2014. Our La Porte Ethylene Expansion is well underway. All major equipment is expected to be onsite by year end. We will complete the project during the second quarter 2014 turnaround. At Channelview the furnaces have been ordered, the foundations poured and we'll soon begin erecting steel. We plan to mechanically complete the project at the end of 2014 with a startup to first quarter of 2015. The third ethylene expansion at Corpus Christi is in the permitting process. Long lead equipment will be ordered this quarter and construction will begin as soon as we receive our permits. Timing for completion is estimated to be late 2015.\\n    The TexStar ethane fractionator project at Corpus Christi is also proceeding. This is not our asset, but we will be a beneficiary of the project through more flexible ethane supply and pricing. As you can see from the picture, this project is nearing completion and TexStar plans to start up before year end.\\n    Our 220 million pound polyethylene Channelview project is also proceeding with plans for completion during the first quarter of 2014. In 2014 we will also be adding two lines of polypropylene compound in Asia.\\n    Overall, all of the projects are progressing well. We are facing some cost inflation but a significant percentage of this exposure has been removed by our schedule and contracting strategies. We are well ahead of most competitors' projects, reducing the potential for construction delays and overruns. There is a tremendous amount of activity underway. To put it in perspective, we are currently working with ten E&C firms and seven construction firms. On a typical day we have approximately 750 contractors on our sites working multiple shifts.\\n    Let's turn to Slide Number 17 and I'll wrap up. The third quarter continued a trend of strong earnings. The O&P Americans and I&D businesses continued to benefit from cheap natural gas and natural gas liquids. Our Refining segment has been difficult. We have taken actions to increase our operating flexibility and during the second quarter of 2014 we expect to have increased access to heavy Canadian crude. During October business conditions have been similar to those experienced during the third quarter. The charts included in the presentation provide some perspective on benchmark margins. We expect the key trends that have driven our success to continue throughout the quarter, but I want to remind you that we will likely be subject to normal seasonality in some businesses. This typically manifests itself in somewhat lower oxyfuel and C4 chemical spreads, slower polyolefin sales during the holidays and potentially increased propylene glycol sales to the air craft deicing industry.\\n    Our team is on top of all the details and we are excited about our growth projects, but we haven't lost our perspective. Safety remains our top priority, followed by reliable operations and cost management. We also recognize that while our past results have been impressive our future results are what really matter. Thank you for your interest in LyondellBasell.\\n    We're now pleased to take questions, Maryanne .\\n    \\n    \\n    \"}),\n",

       "  {'text': '\\n    \\n    \\n    At this time, I would like to turn the presentation over to our host, Mr. Paul Elenio, Chief Financial Officer.  Please proceed.\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    With that behind us, I\\'d now like to turn the call over to Arbor\\'s President and CEO, Ivan Kaufman.\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    Thank you, Paul, and welcome everybody.  As you take a look at our press release this morning, the strong operating results for the first quarter reflected solid execution of our business strategy and the focused subject of our company.  We are first and foremost committed to enhancing our long-term value of our franchise and maximize the shareholder value.\\n    Paul will review the financials results with you in a few minutes.  In the meantime, I\\'d like to update you on the progress we\\'re making in building and growing our franchise.  And it\\'s been well over an year now, since we established some very critical objectives that were imperative for us to achieve.\\n    They were imperative because we needed to execute them properly in order for us to appropriately position our company in a very dynamic and competitive environment, an environment that is growing increasingly competitive marked by increased liquidity in the marketplace.  So achieving these objectives was very important for us to be able to execute our strategy appropriately.\\n    Some of these objectives were:  given the market values, to monetize our equity kickers, where appropriate, and recycle as much of that capital as possible to fund the growth of our business; to transition our portfolio to higher quality credit, more stable assets by originating substantial amount of fixed rate loans and whole loan product; to focus on improving the right side of our balance sheet and capital base, allowing it to originate loans throughout the capital structure more efficiently and with greater flexibility; and to decrease the amount of condo concentration in our portfolio.\\n    I am pleased to report that we\\'ve accomplished many of these objectives, while continuing to grow our EPS and dividend.  So let me take a moment to review how we\\'ve achieved some of these objectives and the continued progress we are making in these areas.\\n    I will follow one of the key elements of our business model, our equity kickers.  We\\'ve always used these investments as a critical component of our business and one of the unique ways we\\'ve truly distinguished ourselves from our peers.  As I\\'ve mentioned several times, we would look to monetize these equity kickers, where appropriate.\\n    To help demonstrate the success we\\'ve had in this area, I\\'d like to review some of these transactions.  First, we\\'ve received full distribution totaling approximately $44 million from our investment in prime retail portfolio.  And we believe this portfolio has significant value and appreciation above what we\\'ve received to-date.\\n    Second, we\\'ve created another equity kicker in June 2005 derived from a highly structured transaction with one of our repeat customers.  This was on an upscale boutique hotel in Manhattan, known as \"On the Avenue.\"  In addition to receiving strong returns on our mezzanine and preferred equity loans, we also received a $16 million distribution during the first quarter relating to our 33% profits interest in this transaction.\\n    And recently, we\\'ve announced that we\\'ve entered into a contract to sell one of the Toy buildings as well as the 450 West 33rd Street building in Manhattan.  These contracts are expected to close in the second quarter and, when complete, will result in us receiving around $100 million in capital from these kickers in the six-month period and about $140 million of capital, since we transitioned to a public company in 2004.  This is a clear illustration of the significant value we\\'ve generated from these investments.\\n    We\\'re also able to add a new equity kicker type portfolio during the quarter.  This equity kicker is in the form of 25% profits interest as part of the $7 million loan we originated on a multifamily property in Indianapolis.  The borrower is an experienced owner-operator and one of our repeat clients.  This brings the total number of equity kickers in our portfolio to 11.\\n    In addition, we have borrowers in our pipeline including a potential 50% kicker on the Lake in the Woods deal, which is currently being restructured.  This demonstrates our unique ability to add transaction to fund from our portfolio that would allow us to share in the upside of real estate, while which continues to be a major component of our business model.\\n    Overall, our equity kickers have had several benefits to us.  First, they contribute greatly to our earnings and book value per share.  In fact, the On the Avenue, Toy and 450 West transactions alone will contribute around $4 per share to our book value.\\n    Second, they generate significant tax deferred cash proceeds, which allow us to grow our business by investing these funds in new loans and investments to create a consistent earnings growth.  Finally, these cash distributions greatly increase our capital base without diluting our current shareholders, which allows us to be very selective in issuing additional equity.\\n    The market remains extremely competitive, and we continue to execute our goal of transitioning our portfolio by originating loans more in the middle of our capital structure.  In doing so, we are constantly improving the overall credit quality of our portfolio further insulating us from credit deterioration in this volatile market.\\n    In fact, loans and first lien positions represented around 75% of our first quarter originations and about 55% of our portfolio as of March 31st, 2007 compared to around 30% of our portfolio on the same date in 2006 and 2005.  And the loan to value of our portfolio was 67% March 31st, 2007 compared to 69% the previous year and 69% in December 31, \\'06 and 70% at March 31st, \\'06.\\n    Even more significant is that our weighted average median dollars outstanding in our portfolio has declined 18% from 57% at March 31st, \\'06 to 47% at March 31st, \\'07.  The duration of our portfolio has also increased considerably from 26 months at December 31, \\'06 to 31 months at March 31st, \\'07.\\n    This strategy has reduced the yield in our portfolio, which we expect to continue over the next several quarters, as some of our higher risk, higher yielding loans continue to prepay.  We\\'d much rather sacrifice some yield for higher credit quality, especially in today\\'s tenuous environment.\\n    We believe transitioning our portfolio to higher credit quality, more stable assets serves us far better over the long term.  As a result, we continue to reduce borrowing costs and increase leverage where appropriate providing us with superior adjusted returns.  We remain focused on increasing the amount of longer-term fixed rate loans, which represent approximately 27% of our portfolio at March 31st, \\'07, up 2% from December 31st, \\'06.\\n    This quarter, we originated $178 million of new fixed rate loans.  These loans create more stable return for our portfolio because they generally include prepayment protection.  And by swapping out the rates in our CDOs, we\\'re able to lock in attractive spreads.  Our goal is to continue to increase the fixed rate portion of our portfolio.\\n    We\\'re also continuing to focus on improving the right side of our balance sheet and our capital structure really laying the foundation to allow us to operate more efficiently and with greater flexibility.  With 1.2 billion of debt outstanding in three CDOs, we have enhanced our product offerings and can originate loans throughout the capital structure more efficiently.\\n    We\\'ve also reduced our borrowing costs and increased leverage, where appropriate, resulting in superior returns on our investments.  In marker permitting, we\\'ll look forward to issuing another CDO some time in the fourth quarter of this year.\\n    In April, we increased the capacity with one of our warehouse facilities by $275 million.  We improved our advance rates and reduced borrowing costs by 25 to 50 basis points in this facility.  We also issued approximately 52 million of trust-preferred securities at 2.43 over LIBOR.  To-date, we\\'ve issued approximately 270 million of trust-preferred securities, which continued to provide us with a low cost alternative to raising equity.\\n    Our originations network is very deep and versatile.  In this quarter, we added 570 million of new loans and investments, of which about 530 million was funded.  We experienced $270 million of runoff this quarter, of which 115 million was retained in new loans and 154 million was either sold or refinanced outside Arbor.\\n    This result in net growth in our portfolio of 14% in the quarter.  Once again, we achieved the significant growth by continuing to prove that credit quality of our portfolio generated superior risk adjusted returns.  Since this book was heavily weighted towards the end of the first quarter, we will receive the full benefit of the income on these investments, going forward.\\n    We do expect payrolls in the second and third quarter to be higher than in the first quarter but feel confident based on the strength of our originations network upping our guidance from an annual net growth rate 15 to 25% to 25 to 40% for 2007.  This translates to net growth in the portfolio of 75 million to 175 million a quarter for the remaining three quarters of \\'07.\\n    With the contract we entered into selling of the Toy Building and the plans to even redevelop the remaining building into rental or marketers for sale, our condo concentration is now possibly 10% with 9% in New York.  Of 9% concentration in New York, approximately 90% of our risk loan balances are secured by pre-sold units with significant non-refundable deposits, leaving only around 1% exposed to the market.\\n    And in April a $37 million loan on a condo project in New York paid off reducing our condo concentration to approximately 9%.  This reduction in our condo concentration will allow us to take advantage of a likely liquidity in that sector and pursue some very good growth opportunities going forward.\\n    Overall, our portfolio remains extremely healthy and we continue to add depths and experience in our dedicated 101 personal asset management function.  We are firm believers in growing this area in line with our portfolio.  We know this function is a critical part of our business to ensure a profitable performance of our loan investment portfolio.\\n    Last quarter we spoke about an $8.5 million nonperforming loan in our portfolio of loans at Lake in the Woods.  In line with our plans to take control on recapitalize this asset we purchased the remaining portion of the first mortgage debt of approximately $36 million in the first quarter.  In April we accepted a deed in lieu of foreclosure and identified a group of experienced operators who will purchase roughly at 50% interest in exchange for approximately 3 million of new equity.\\n    Our intention is to restructure and retain the first mortgage debt and approximately 50% profits interest in the property.  The ability to reposition this asset creates a loan with a strong risk adjusted return by retaining potential upside in the real estate.  It\\'s a direct result of our underwriting this asset initially at the right levels and having experienced hands-on asset managers and real estate professionals in here.\\n    We maintained our basic credit philosophy.  We will not make a loan unless we are prepared to own the asset if the need arises as, in fact, with this transaction.  I wish to emphasize that our manager, Arbor Commercial Mortgage, has once again elected to take 100% of its incentive management fee in stock.  To-date, the manager has an approximate 21% ownership interest in Arbor and believes in the long-term value of Arbor\\'s common stock and is extremely committed to keeping his interest in line with shareholders.\\n    And finally, I want to take a moment to welcome John Bishar to our Board as a new independent director.  John currently holds a very significant position as Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Chief Governance Officer of KeySpan Corporation, as S&P 500 Company and the largest distributor of natural gas in the Northeast.\\n    I\\'ve had the privilege of working with John as a board member on another public company in the past, and I am very pleased that he is joining us.  John brings tremendous board experience especially in the areas of real estate, governance and compliance matters.  We look forward to his guidance, and I am sure he will make a very significant contribution for the Company.\\n    Now, I am pleased to turn you over to Paul to review some of the financial results.\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    Thank you, Ivan, and good morning again, everybody.  As noted in the press release, our earnings for the quarter were 97 cents per common share on a fully diluted basis.  Obviously, there was a big impact from the $16 million distribution we received from our equity kicker in the On the Avenue property.\\n    This equity interest is owned to a corporate subsidiary, and the income is subject to corporate tax.  After providing for a tax provision and the incentive management fee paid to the manager, we recorded approximately 7.4 million in income during the quarter related to this transaction.  We\\'ve had a positive impact from one of our equity kickers in 10 quarters now and have recorded income from these investments in seven quarters.\\n    In addition, as Ivan mentioned, once we closed the Toy and 450 West 33rd Street deals, we estimate that we will receive around 100 million of capital in a rather short period of time from these investments.  We estimate that this will increase our economic book value per share to approximately $21 from around $17.  Our equity kickers will have contributed about $6 in book value per share since we had been a public company.\\n    Equally important has been our ability to structure these deals in a tax efficient manner, which allows us to retain a substantial amount of this capital to invest in new loans and investments creating a steady earnings stream.  We realized that the monetization of these equity kickers may cause our earnings to be lumpy.\\n    However, these investments are clearly a significant part of our business model and have contributed greatly to our bottom-line capital base and liquidity, which is consistent with our philosophy of creating long-term shareholder and franchise value.\\n    The numbers in the press release are fairly self-explanatory, but I\\'ll highlight a few points I believe may benefit from some clarification.  First and very significantly, our average balance in core investments grew about 221 million from last quarter, primarily due to significant growth we achieved in the fourth quarter.\\n    As Ivan mentioned, our portfolio growth of 278 million was heavily weighted towards the end of the first quarter, which means we will receive a full economic effect of this growth in future quarters.  The yield for the quarter on these core investments was around 9.68% compared to 10.15% for the fourth quarter.  Our yield on core investments was approximately 9.93% for the fourth quarter, excluding income from the acceleration of fees and IRR lookbacks, as compared to yield of around 9.47 this quarter, excluding similar items.\\n    You may recall that the yield on the loans that paid off in the fourth quarter were higher than the yield on the new loans we put on.  We saw the full impact of this during the first quarter and this occurred again on our new guidance.\\n    In addition, the weighted average all in yield on our portfolio was 9.07% at March 31st, 2007, down from around 9.56% at December 31st, 2006.  As we have mentioned several times, we continued to improve the credit quality and stability of our portfolio by focusing on loans more in the middle of the capital structure.\\n    Our unique ability to going on equity kickers have not only significantly increased our bottom-line in capital base but also allowed us to improve the credit quality of our portfolio, while continuing to grow earnings.  This strategy is resulted in lower yield in our portfolio as some of our higher yield in loan continued to prepay.\\n    The first quarter yields reflect our disciplined approach of increasing the credit quality stability of our portfolio.  This is based in the opportunities we are seeing in the market from a risk adjustment basis and with 75% of our first quarter volume in first new loans clearly reflects our view in today\\'s market.\\n    As we mentioned we do expect this trend to continue over the next few quarters but with the increases in our leverage and reduce borrowing cost, these higher credit quality investments generate excellent risk adjusted returns.\\n    In line with this strategy, we continue to focus on reducing our borrowing cost, which decreased 22 basis points this quarter from 7.11 for the fourth quarter to 6.89 for the first quarter.  This is primarily due to realizing the full effect of the reduced borrowing cost from our third CEO, which closes in mid December.\\n    In addition as Ivan mentioned in April, we successfully negotiated the reduction in our borrowing cost on one of our existing warehouse facilities by 25 to 50 basis points depending in the type of investment finance.\\n    The average balance in our debt facility grew by 258 million from last quarter, 37 million more than the increase in our average quarter investments.  This was primarily due to a 28 million increase in the average leverage restricted cash balance and our CDOs from a 109 million in the fourth quarter to a 137 million in the first quarter.\\n    The average leverage in core assets was around 81% for the first quarter, up from 77% from the fourth quarter.  Including the trust-preferred to as debt, the average leverage was 92% for the first quarter, as compared to 89% for the fourth quarter.\\n    Our overall leverage ratio was 3.12 to 1 at March 31st, as compared to 2.7 to 1 at December 31st.  If you include the trust-referred securities as debt, the overall leverage ratio was 5.6 to 1 at March 31st and 5.0 to 1 at December 31st.\\n    The increased leverage is due to our ability to effectively originate higher credit quality loans more in the middle of the capital stack.  This allows us to reduce borrowing costs and increase leverage where appropriate, generating superior risk adjusted returns.\\n    We do expect our leverage ratios decline in the second quarter, due to the 51.5 million of trust preferred securities we issued in April and the monetization of the toy and 450 West 33rd Street equity kicker, which will add significant capital to our equity base.\\n    There were no other significant changes on the balance sheet but I would like to point out that we did sell our MBS boards during the quarter as they would no longer needed for the regulatory purposes they were purchased for.\\n    Operating expenses were fairly flat as compared to previous quarters with the exception of the incentive management fee, which was higher than last quarter, which was on the Avenue transaction.\\n    Once again our manager has opted to take the entire fee in stock.  We did include the schedule summarizing our equity participation interest and IRR lookbacks this quarter.  As Ivan, stated we originated another investment within equity kicker.  This brings the total number of equity kickers in our portfolio to 11.\\n    As we stated many time, these investment have contributed greatly to our bottom-line liquidity capital base on our significant component of our business model.  Finally, on an unrelated note, you may have seen in our proxy filing that we issued additional restricted stock brands of approximately 111,000 shares on April 2nd 2007.\\n    Shares were issued to certain of our employees and the employees of our management.  One fit best immediately and the remaining four fits just ratably over the ensuing four years.\\n    With that I will turn it back to the operator.  And we\\'ll be happy to answer any questions you may have at this time.\\n    \\n    \\n    '}),\n",

       "  {'text': \"\\n    \\n    \\n    At this time, I would like to introduce Jessica Cho of Pacira Pharmaceuticals. Ma'am, you may begin.\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    Thank you and good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today from Pacira are Dave Stack, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman; Jim Scibetta, President & Chief Financial Officer; and Scott Braunstein, Senior Vice President, Strategy & Corporate Development.\\n    Any such forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that the company believes are reasonable and that are subject to a wide range of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.\\n    Many of these and other risks and uncertainties are described in the Risk Factors section of the company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other filings with the SEC, which are available through the Investors & Media section of the Pacira website at www.pacira.com or on the SEC website at www.sec.gov.\\n    And with that, we'll hear first from Dave.\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    Thanks, Jess. And good morning, everyone. 2015 was an important period for Pacira. We finished the year with another solid quarter of growth in line with seasonal expectations. And we achieved an amicable resolution with the FDA, reaffirming the clarity of the broad label – the broad scope of the indication of proof for EXPAREL in 2011.\\n    But more importantly, we spent 2015 building up the infrastructure that we believe will enable us to leverage the multiple opportunities for EXPAREL, our DepoFoam pipeline and our commercial organization to advance the Pacira brand in both the near-term and the intermediate term.\\n    Let's start with our flagship product EXPAREL, the only non-opioid, long acting, analgesic formulation of bupivacaine currently approved to provide postsurgical pain control. Our key strategy remains making EXPAREL accessible to as many patients and healthcare providers as possible, developing clinical data sets, enhanced recovery protocol and providing package configurations at a price which demonstrates the significant value of EXPAREL.\\n    Given the dramatic societal need for reduced opioid strategies in the very large patient audiences, our strategy will provide customer access points across a wide range of procedures and treatment settings, driving real growth for our business for the long-term. The market response for the resolution of the FDA warning letter has been very positive. The affirmation of the broad label has provided the basis of healthcare providers to challenge decisions, which limited access to EXPAREL based on inaccurate information provided in the warning letter.\\n    In addition, we have number of programs involving infiltration into the transversus abdominis plane or TAP blocks that have been initiated to provide pain control, reduced opioids in important procedures such as C Section. Of special interest of many surgeons is the opportunity to mix bupivacaine and EXPAREL in the same syringe, providing for ease-of-use and another opportunity to improve surgical technique in patient care. In addition to the enhanced label which the FDA confirm supports the use of EXPAREL across a range of surgical procedures. We are letting our customers know there will be no pricing increase implemented this year. As a demonstration of our commitment to partnering with our C-suite and clinical customers, who are under pressure to plan and budget in this dynamic environment of bundle payments and accountable care.\\n    We also plan to introduce the smaller four pack configuration of EXPAREL in Q3, along with the 10 ml vial to accommodate smaller surgeries, including oral maxillofacial procedures and plastic surgery procedures many of which are performed in the ambulatory or office settings.\\n    With the FDA confirmation of TAP infiltration procedures are covered in the EXPAREL label, we are pursuing this opportunity for strategic procedures of interest. An article published in the International Anesthesia Research Journal, Dr.  from the University of Texas Southwestern compared abdominal hysterectomy patients who received infiltration with EXPAREL, the patients who received bilateral ultrasound guided TAP blocks with bupivacaine and found EXPAREL patients received pure opioids and experienced significantly lower pain scores at  with cocktails.\\n    Dr. Hutchins et al from the University of Minnesota, published similar findings in the September gynecologic oncology on the hysterectomy patients who received TAP with EXPAREL versus TAP with bupivacaine with the EXPAREL patients having significantly decreased opioid use, lower pain scores, decreased incidence of nausea and vomiting and a trend towards decreased length of stay.\\n    In a study published in the October supplement of the Journal of the American Oncology of Surgeon, Hackensack University Medical Center's, Dr. Burnett et al, showed how EXPAREL is part of the multi-modal therapy for multi-model therapy for  patients reduced reliance on opioid PCA by 30% through 72 hours with a trend toward shorter hospitalization.\\n    Studies are continued to demonstrate the value of EXPAREL infiltration as a platform for multi-model reduced opioid strategy across the broad range of orthopedics procedures, leading to faster ambulation, reduced length of stay and improved bottom line for hospitals.\\n    For spin surgery, the desire to reduce the length of stay and transfer lumbar fusions to the outpatient setting, which requires appropriate patient selection and adequate patient management to allow for quicker return to function, has led to EXPAREL based care. Riesenburger from Tufts University presented a study at the Congress of Neurological Surgeons Annual Meeting, comparing EXPAREL to standard of care postoperative analgesics for single level minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion spine surgery. Patients in the EXPAREL arm experienced decreased pain and opiod consumption for the first 24 hours and a decreased length of stay by 1.2 days.\\n    A primary article from  in the Journal of Orthopedic Advances demonstrated that while both femoral nerve block with bupivacaine and surgical site periarticular infiltration with EXPAREL provided adequate pain control in the total knee arthroplasty that was a significant one half day reduction in the hospital length of stay and more than a $2000 cost savings in favor of EXPAREL.\\n    We believe that these metrics will be of increasing importance as the market moves towards bundle payments for these orthopedic procedures. Pain control with a femoral never block remains a predominant technique for total knee arthroplasty in the United States and this paper is of real importance given the CMS bundled care program for total joint arthroplasty is being initiated in April.\\n    We believe the low opiod pain control with EXPAREL is part of a multimodal strategy will be a critical component of overall care in the evolving bundle environment. As an example and why you recently published their early 2013 results in the Journal of Arthroplasty, based on experience and implementing the CMS's bundled payment for care improvement initiative for total joint replacement. And why you incorporated EXPAREL into their multimodal regimen for managing pain and across the 90 day episode of care following patient discharge, the hospital was able to significantly decrease discharge that we have in skilled nursing facilities, reduce readmissions and lower hospital cost. Achievements that have been approved upon, and subsequently presented at several medical meetings and will form the basis of future publications. NYU is just one example of institutions adapting to capitated reimbursement models. Based on the understanding that 50% of the cost of joint episode is driven by post-surgical aftercare. We are working on how to best position EXPAREL as an important component of the bundle payment environment.\\n    As such, early ambulation and discharge to home rather than expensive skilled nursing facilities to make a significant financial impact on the bundle. At the upcoming American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons meeting in Orlando, there are a number of papers discussing the use of EXPAREL in orthopedic procedures. Overall, we have learned that there are procedure specific administration technique and higher injection volumes required for these surgeries in order to reproduce optimal results and minimize variability.\\n    One specific highlight comes from the Rubin Institute for Advanced Orthopedics at Sinai Hospital. Mark 00:08:59 will be presenting a study assessing more than 90,000 patients from the premier database, undergoing total knee arthroplasty. Showing that EXPAREL patients shorten their hospital stay by half a day, and had a higher likelihood of being discharged to home as mentioned above a significant opportunity for our hospital customers in a bundle environment.\\n    Also at AOS we are supporting three symposium focusing on multimodal pain management and the inpatient and outpatient studying joint knee arthroplasty. The content will be focused on the importance of technique and periarticular injections, important facts on bundled payment, risk stratification and opioid management as well as patient selection and management for outpatient arthroplasty. These components including the use of EXPAREL, are critically important for the above in best practice of how to treat post surgical pain today. Last week, the American Pain Society, with the input from the American Society of Anesthesiologists and approval from the American Society for regional anesthesia developed and published a clinical practice guideline to promote evidence-based effective and safe postoperative pain management. In its recommendation of surgical side local infiltration as an effective component of multimodal analgesia, the guideline specifically points to EXPAREL, underscores the importance of specific local infiltration techniques depending on the procedure type and calls for the incorporation of non-opioid analgesics around the clock into multimodal analgesic regimen and advises clinicians to improve patient education.\\n    I would like to switch gears to update our launch that plans for oral surgery. Recall that as a component of the FDA settlement in December, the FDA confirmed that oral surgery is part of our approved indication and we are preparing for a late third quarter 2016 launch. The launch timing is targeted around the annual meeting of the American Association of oral and maxillofacial surgeons in September and as a result and as well as our readiness to introduce the previously mentioned 10 ml vial and four pack configuration.\\n    This meeting – this morning, we announced results from our third molar study, which is effectively a Phase 4 study that further supports our launch efforts with a per protocol analysis, demonstrating statistical significance in an intention to treat analysis strongly trending towards significance. In spite of the underpowered study size resulting from the elimination of a site due to protocol violations.\\n    The oral surgery trial was performed at three sites in the United States, two of these sites were strongly positive and one site provide a data which conflicted with the other two sites and were data was not collected according to the protocol. In addition to the data collection issues that was lower, no opioids used in the placebo arm at this site and the pharmacokinetic profile for EXPAREL was markedly different as compared to the other two sites in a trial resulting in a distortion of the pain profiles reported in the trial arms. As a result of the number of protocol violations and the nature of these issues, the decision was made to eliminate this site from the analysis resulting in an underpowered study size and expensive per protocol analysis with the study demonstrated statistical significance of the primary endpoint vary under the curve of the NRS pain intensity score through 48 hours of P equals 0.0007. An intention to treat analysis indicated a strong trend with a P of 0.06 in favor of the primary endpoint a trend that would have been statistically significant with proper study power. From this data and from the additional market activities, we know that when used with appropriate technique EXPAREL provides pain controls reduced opioids in oral surgery, as well as develop the other procedure study to date. In concert with our launch we plan to generate phase IV studies and other oral and maxillofacial surgeries to provide clinical guidance to the oral maxillofacial community phase IV initiatives such as the Full-Arch Surgical Therapy trial or FAST trial utilizes the 20 ml vial of EXPAREL to evaluate its use in all and four dental implants. We expect completion of this trial prior to the launch meeting.\\n    We have also initiated the phase III nerve block trial to achieve our nerve block indication on the EXPAREL label. Two nerve block studies will evaluate EXPAREL in upper extremity procedures administered as a brachial plexus block and a lower extremity femoral nerve block and in some lower extremity femoral nerve block procedures.\\n    We expect top-line data by the end of 2016 and if all goes this plan, we will file an sNDA in Q1 2017 and prepare for launch in Q4 2017. We have also initiated randomized clinical trial in total knee. The objective of this study is to standardize technique in this technique sensitive procedure. By increasing the total volume to 120 ml utilizing a bupivacaine bridge and providing a highly descriptive infiltration technique including infiltration into the periosteum and posterior capsule. As with the nerve block trials, if the trial goes as planned, we expect to have data by the end of 2016. We also plan to initiate a second randomized clinical trial in Spain in late 2016, with top line data expected in 2017.\\n    Another important strategy for EXPAREL is to collaborate with major academic centers with the randomized clinical trials addressing medical needs, identified by these leading institutions. Two specific examples of our work are a Cleveland Clinic and M.D. Anderson. At Cleveland clinic, findings from an earlier observational study suggested an EXPAREL TAP to provide a pain control equal to epidural, but with a 56% reduction in opioid and a 2.2 day reduction in the length of stay.\\n    We're hoping to confirm these findings by collaborating with the Cleveland Clinic on a prospective randomized clinical trial to compare EXPAREL TAP to epidural pain management and large abdominal surgery. A successful trial will provide the basis of simplified patient care, by providing an alternative to epidurals. At M.D. Anderson, OB/GYN oncology study will compare EXPAREL to be bupivacaine infiltration, as part of an enhanced recovery protocol to reduce opioids and investigate the opportunity to provide a roadmap for improving the percentage of patients who are treated for gynecological cancers, without the need for opioids.\\n    Our strategy is to publish these enhanced recovery protocols, to provide the basis for rapid best practice transfer to healthcare providers across the United States. Our relationship with the United States Department of Defense or DOD has been important for the overall success of EXPAREL.\\n    This year, we also solidified the commercial progress made to date with the DOD, by developing and deploying enhanced recovery protocols that integrate EXPAREL for a variety of surgical procedures across the tracking services. We are initiating a multi-branch DOD postsurgical pain registry, which includes Walter Reed Hospital and the Balboa Naval Medical Center. The registry will use NIH outcomes to examine acute and long-term consequences of postsurgical pain management strategies, including use of regional anesthesia techniques, EXPAREL and other multimodal therapies.\\n    Following on patients out to three-months, the registry will focus on open laparoscopic abdominal surgery, orthopedic joint surgery, neurological spine surgery and plastic surgery including major breast surgery.\\n    We also are continuing to develop programs for chronic pain and pediatric use of EXPAREL, which we will highlight on future calls. On top of the tremendous opportunity with EXPAREL, we see significant value on our proprietary DepoFoam delivery technology, which provides a 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for all future DepoFoam based products, potentially diminishing clinical development cost and time to market.\\n    At present, we expect IND approvals for DepoTranexamic Acid and DepoMeloxicam in the next several months, allowing a Phase 1 study to be initiated with DepoMeloxicam and a Phase 2 study to be initiated with DepoTranexamic Acid in the back half of 2016. We look forward to sharing information on additional DepoFoam products over the next several quarters.\\n    Jim will elaborate further on the leverage provided by our financials and manufacturing capacity and spray process. But before turning it over to him, let me emphasize that we believe that we are in an enviable position of not only having a successful product, which helps patients every day, but also an established foundation to execute an expansive clinical and commercial opportunities outlined today.\\n    The renewed focus resulting from the FDA resolution has given us a chance to take a more proactive look at the way the U.S addresses the opioid epidemic that is gripping our nation. As publicized by numerous reports from 60 minutes on TV to the New England Journal of Medicine. Starting this year, we plan on heightening our work with legislators advocacy groups and government agencies, who are interested in finding real solutions to the source of the opioid epidemic, not just dealing with the aftermath on human life.\\n    We have significant leverage across the organization. In manufacturing, as we moved the commercial manufacturing of EXPAREL to the UK to our partnership with Patheon. We have the opportunity to provide improved margins, reduce our royalty burden and provide the advantage of a – of the patent box tax strategy, while freeing up the San Diego facilities to manufacture our DepoFoam pipeline products.\\n    In commercial, as we launched EXPAREL and oral surgery, nerve block, pediatrics, chronic pain and with partners in the rest of world in animal health. We believe we will require modest investments in commercial resources relative to the revenue opportunities to be realized. In clinical development, based on our deep relationships with key opinion leaders and anesthesia and surgery as well as our collaborations with major academic centers, we have a unique understanding of the needs of these customers, especially important as we moved to a 23-hour stay environment for surgical patients.\\n    With our resources, as a profitable company, we believe we are positioned to aggressively invest in our products and pipeline without the current need for any additional funding or dilution. We have the commitment the energy and resources, and we look forward to 2016 and beyond. As we partnered with our healthcare customers to improve patient care and help health economics. Above all, we remain dedicated to our mission of improving patient cares – improving patient's quality of life. For the past three years, we have provided non-profits such as operation walk, surgery on Sunday and other missions with EXPAREL to support the need for non-opioid options for underprivileged patients in an areas of the world where surgical care is urgently needed.\\n    Today we are – to-date, we are proud to have treated over 1,000 patients with EXPAREL in support of the missions in Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Cuba,  Honduras, Bolivia and Panama to provide low opioid multi-model pains therapy. We will look forward to continuing our support of these surgeons, anesthesiologists, nurses and other healthcare providers who make these missions possible. And with that, let's go to Jim.\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    All right. Thank you, Dave. In my comments, I'll review our 2015 financial results and provide an update on operations in the context of our outlook for 2016. To recap, in early January, we preannounced EXPAREL sales to $67.2 million for Q4 and $239.9 million for 2015. Our total sales were $69.3 million for Q4 and $249 million for full-year 2015.\\n    In retrospect, we're quite pleased with year-over-year growth in excess of 25%, in the year that was burdened by then now resolved the FDA warning letter. As of Q4, a total of almost 4,000 accounts, 3,917 to be specific have order EXPAREL since launch an add-on of 127 new accounts this quarter, a modest of growing number, which continue to be ambulatory surgery center customers, substantiating the nascent move our procedures from the inpatient to outpatient setting.\\n    We achieved the non-GAAP gross margin of 74% in Q4 and 73% for the full year. And this was achieved while operating our plan for local potential capacity further validating the gross margin opportunities for the product. Non-GAAP R&D spend was $11.2 million in Q4 and this included expenses associated with preparatory work for our two phase III nerve block studies and the randomized controlled trial in knee that Dave outlined earlier.\\n    Total 2015 non-GAAP R&D expense was $23.5 million in line with our prior non-GAAP R&D guidance. Q4 non-GAAP SG&A was $31.5 million, with legal expenses related to the FDA resolution driving most of the fourth quarter spend uptick. We finished with 2015 non-GAAP SG&A expense totaling $116.8 million, on the lower end of our previous annual guidance. Non-GAAP net income was $8.3 million or $0.20 per diluted share in the fourth quarter and it was $39.4 million or $0.95 per diluted share, for all of 2015 marking another period of non-GAAP profitability for Pacira.\\n    And for the sake of transparency and connecting the dots of our GAAP and non-GAAP results, stock based compensation expense was $9.7 million and $33.4 million for 2015 overall, and for the year our stock based comp expense accounted for 8%, 18% and 16% of GAAP, COGS, R&D and SG&A expenses respectively. In 2015, our adjusted EBITDA exceeded $50 million. And so, in spite of a $41 million CapEx spend in 2015, our balance sheet remained strong, and we started 2015 with over a $170 million of cash in investments on hand. Let me now turn to the 2016 outlook and start with some additional color, on what we're expediting in the field.\\n    From the resolution in December with the FDA, we've been urgently training our customer base and professionals on our new clarified and expanded EXPAREL label and to the label clarifications we received from Dr. Woodcock, related to Tap blocks.\\n    We've been preparing promotional material specific to our surgical targets, including surgeon case reports of how they use EXPAREL, in a specific surgery, describing the amount of selling and marketing they use and specifying their technique with administering EXPAREL, in that surgery. We now have numerous reports from the field, albeit anecdotal at this point, but how the FDA resolution in new label have impacted the dynamic in the marketplace and opened up new doors for us, and they generally fall into the following three categories.\\n    Number one, orthopedic surgeons, general surgeons doing large abdominal cases and plastic surgeons doing breast reconstruction cases, ad mixing with market and expanding their volumes and expressing additional excitement about the consistency and duration of efficacy of EXPAREL. Two, anesthesiologist delighted to know they are empowered by the FDA to use EXPAREL in tabs for soft tissue procedures. And three, all of these surgeons and anesthesiologist having greater confidence to navigate and if required confirm their pharmacy adversaries about the utility of EXPAREL for their patients. And we see this happening in all types of accounts in small and mid-size independent not-for-profit hospitals, as well as in hospitals within the major for-profit and not-for-profit chain.\\n    So, how do we think all of these will impact the EXPAREL sales trajectory for 2016, taking into account the complex dynamics within hospitals, which impacted the pace of adoption, there is typically a quarter or two lag before the opening of a new door fosters additional box sales at a material level. We hope that these initial anecdotes we witness become pervasive and if so we expect growth to accelerate in the second half of the year.\\n    Specifically to the near-term, I'll update a comment I made during the December FDA settlement call, Dave made at J.P. Morgan Conference and we see the investment community appears to now fully appreciate. Because of the notable elective procedures seasonality, most market lead a high procedure volumes in Q4 and low procedure volumes following in Q1 coupled with the expectation that the benefits from the FDA resolution will become evident later in 2016. We would expect first quarter EXPAREL sales to be lower or flat compared to Q4 sequentially.\\n    Importantly, as we close in on our fourth full-year since the April 2012 launch of EXPERAL, we believe that it's time to move away from a focus on quarter-over-quarter sequential growth and focus instead on year-over-year growth by quarter. So, please don't misunderstand my previous comment, we absolutely expect to continue to be a growth story in Q1 2016 compared to Q1 2015 and we expect the quarterly growth trajectory in the second half of 2016 to accelerate on a year-over-year basis.\\n    Turning to gross margins, I want to extend the soft margin guidance, I've discussed in the past few quarters and that we expect our 2016 non-GAAP gross margins to moderate a bit, compared to the 77% and 74% on non-GAAP gross margins, we achieved in Q3 and Q4 respectively.\\n    Recall that with a high fixed cost infrastructure in our current manufacturing facility, up against the fact that we'll be moderating production given the inventory on hand, our reported gross margins will moderate accordingly. But we do expect to achieve the 85% gross margin we've guided toward in a few years out, with the full benefit of the anticipated growth revenue and the new manufacturing suites at our current – at our manufacturing partner, Patheon.\\n    For SG&A expenses on a non-GAAP basis, we're guiding to a $125 million to a $135 million in 2016 which at the midpoint is about a 10% increase from our $117 million actuals in 2015. The increase is almost entirely attributable to sales and marketing investments and expanding our sales force by $20 million from $90 million to $110 million, running aggressive patient advocacies programs that Dave referred to and for educational programs related to perhaps the old surgery launch and bundle payments, all great opportunities for Pacira.\\n    We expect our G&A expense will increase very modestly over 2015 and keeping with our philosophy around financial discipline. For R&D expenses, on a non-GAAP basis we're guiding to $60 million to $70 million in 2016, reflecting a new period of growth and investment for Pacira. We're very excited in making the investment in support of oral surgery, nerve block, the CKA infiltration, RCP and for both of our announced pipeline products, DepoTranexamic Acid and DepoMeloxicam which we expect to be in human clinical development in 2016. We expect our 2016 CapEx spend to be in the $35 million to $40 million range, mostly again for manufacturing expansion. And we're tracking along our projected timelines for our three major projects. One, over Patheon, we completed setting up the EXPAREL manufacturing sched we successfully installed in Q3 for the first Patheon suite and we are targeting a Q1, 2017 approval. Two, we continue to make progress on the second EXPAREL Patheon suite, that scaled up 200 leader system. We expect the manufacturing equipment to be delivered to Patheon later this year, which puts us on track for a 2019 approval. And three, with the oversight from our Pacira UK leadership, we anticipate moving forward with fabrication of the spray manufacturing system in 2016 and with the time to ship installing tech transfer to a third-party site, we are still targeting 2019 for approval.\\n    At our Science Center Campus in San Diego, we've transitioned what we referred to as Suite A into a clinical suite and we are currently DepoTranexamic Acid in Suite A, using the equipment we used for the 2012 launch of EXPAREL. The advantage here is that, if we choose to, we could also launch DepoTXA out of the suite. And therefore our 505(b)(2) development timelines for DepoTXA are not in any way burden by the scale up of the manufacturing process, the way it was for EXPAREL and Depo sites many years back.\\n    This speaks to one aspect of a leverage the of our infrastructure that Dave referred to. We also have significant leverage in our P&L, and then we expect top line growth to come without having to make significant investments in SG&A. In terms of the tax outlook on future profitability, we have cumulative net operating losses of around a $330 million. So our requirement to pay cash taxes other than minimum federal and state taxes is burden only by how soon you expect us to realize that level of profitability. And it's a convenient fact that these NOLs will act as a bridge to our transition to the spray process, which provides fact advantages along with driving business goals of higher margins and enhanced patent protection.\\n    So in closing, we feel really fortunate to enter 2016 with a strong cash position while generating significant cash from operations. The innovation behind EXPAREL has taken over 20 years and over $500 million of investment to get to where we are. So we're proud to have gotten here in a shareholder friendly manner evidenced by a fully diluted share count limited to 41 million shares.\\n    This is a particularly good time, as everybody knows, to not dependant on the capital markets. And we're in a strong position to fund the value driving EXPAREL and pipeline development spend I outlined, plus the continued investment on our manufacturing infrastructure for both EXPAREL and our pipeline without currently needing any outside capital.\\n    So, with that, we'll now go to Q&A.
